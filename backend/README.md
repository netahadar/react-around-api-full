# Around the U.S. Back End  
  
## By Neta-Hadat Itzhak  
  
This project is a summary task for the "Back-End" module at Yandex's Full Stack course.
It's still in progress, so code changes are still expected.

In this project I've specialized in:  
  * MongoDB- Create, add, edit and search through the DB.
  * Building an API server with Node.js and Express.JS.
  * Routing.
  * Handle requests.
  * Working with FS.
  * Server testing with Postman.
  * Working with Middlewares.
  And more..
  
## Running the Project  
  
`npm run start` — to launch the server.  
  
`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature.
